//! A simple communication infrastructure providing typed exchange channels.
//!
//! This crate is part of the timely dataflow system, used primarily for its inter-worker communication.
//! It may be indepedently useful, but it is separated out mostly to make clear boundaries in the project.
//!
//! Threads are spawned with an [`allocator::Generic`](./allocator/generic/enum.Generic.html), whose `allocate` method returns a pair of several send endpoints and one
//! receive endpoint. Messages sent into a send endpoint will eventually be received by the corresponding worker,
//! if it receives often enough. The point-to-point channels are each FIFO, but with no fairness guarantees.
//!
//! To be communicated, a type must implement the [`Serialize`](./trait.Serialize.html) trait. A default implementation of `Serialize` is
//! provided for any type implementing [`Abomonation`](../abomonation/trait.Abomonation.html). To implement other serialization strategies, wrap your type
//! and implement `Serialize` for your wrapper.
//!
//! Channel endpoints also implement a lower-level `push` and `pull` interface (through the [`Push`](./trait.Push.html) and [`Pull`](./trait.Pull.html)
//! traits), which is used for more precise control of resources.
//!
//! #Examples
//! ```
//! // configure for two threads, just one process.
//! let config = timely_communication::Configuration::Process(2);
//!
//! // initializes communication, spawns workers
//! let guards = timely_communication::initialize(config, |mut allocator| {
//!     println!("worker {} started", allocator.index());
//!
//!     // allocates pair of senders list and one receiver.
//!     let (mut senders, mut receiver) = allocator.allocate();
//!
//!     // send typed data along each channel
//!     senders[0].send(format!("hello, {}", 0));
//!     senders[1].send(format!("hello, {}", 1));
//!
//!     // no support for termination notification,
//!     // we have to count down ourselves.
//!     let mut expecting = 2;
//!     while expecting > 0 {
//!         if let Some(message) = receiver.recv() {
//!             println!("worker {}: received: <{}>", allocator.index(), message);
//!             expecting -= 1;
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     // optionally, return something
//!     allocator.index()
//! });
//!
//! // computation runs until guards are joined or dropped.
//! if let Ok(guards) = guards {
//!     for guard in guards.join() {
//!         println!("result: {:?}", guard);
//!     }
//! }
//! else { println!("error in computation"); }
//! ```
//!
//! The should produce output like:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! worker 0 started
//! worker 1 started
//! worker 0: received: <hello, 0>
//! worker 1: received: <hello, 1>
//! worker 0: received: <hello, 0>
//! worker 1: received: <hello, 1>
//! result: Ok(0)
//! result: Ok(1)
//! ```
